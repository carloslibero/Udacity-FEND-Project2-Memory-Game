# Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Project 2 - Memory Game

## Memory Game project

Project number 2 from Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree aims to give a hands-on experience with Javascript and DOM manipulation to student, with the goal to create a memory card game.

## Goals

- First practice with JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- Implementation of web browser event handling
- Keep using responsive mindset


## Instructions (As provided from Udacity)

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

- Learned how events integrate to webpage
- Experienced simple game logic

## Project details

This project started with a provided mockup page and already some coding on it. This turns to be a challenge and it gives some sort of a path to follow but adds the need to understand other person view and coding style to the problem.
Thus, the following actions were performed in this provided order:
1. Understood provided logic
1. Implemented my own design to game, with colors, fonts and images
1. Created a deck of cards using the array approach
1. Used provided shuffle function to array
1. Added reload functionality (TBD)
1. Added click functionalities (TBD)
  1. flip (TBD)
  1. flip animation (TBD)
  1. unflip (TBD)
  1. matched (TBD)
  1. matched animation (TBD)
  1. not matched (TBD)
  1. not matched animation (TBD)
  1. Limit to two cards flipped only (TBD)
  1. Move counter (TBD)
1. Created game win condition and modal window (TBD)
1. Implemented game clock (TBD)
1. Implemented game stars logic (3 stars based on number of moves) (TBD)
